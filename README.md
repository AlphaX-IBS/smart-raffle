This repository will contain an Ethereum contract and an associated web to join a raffle for the
upcoming (date to be decided) [Blockchain Litoral](https://www.meetup.com/es/Blockchain-Litoral/)
meetup. The prize will be an amount (also to be decided) of real ether.

The contact will be deployed in one of the testnets, because this is an experiment.

The participants will have to add an unique identifier (probably email or phone number). The winner
will be determined by calling a method on the contract and only the creator of the contract will be
able to do it. This will be done the day of the meetup.
